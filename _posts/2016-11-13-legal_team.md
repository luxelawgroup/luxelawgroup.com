# Rachel Fetter

Rachel Fetter has been a certified paralegal for three years, and is a California Notary Public. She received her A.A. in Language Arts and Humanities at College of Marin, Kentfield.  She then attended the American Bar Association approved program at California State East Bay in Hayward, California where she received her Certificate in Paralegal Studies.  

Prior to graduation, Rachel served as an intern for the California Attorney General’s Office in Oakland, California. There she reported to Senior Legal Specialists and reviewed documents for an Investigative Subpoena regarding a significant state-wide environmental case. She also developed a spreadsheet management system to organize physical document repositories. 

 After graduation, Rachel worked as an administrative assistant for the real estate firm Scheer Law Group, LLP. There she was responsible for case management research and client communications. She catalogued, indexed and archived recently closed case files. 

Thereafter Rachel moved to Delfino Green & Green, a personal injury and workers’ compensation firm. She managed the entire operational client process for the attorneys. This included intake interviews, invoicing and collections, as well as hearings and case closing procedures. Rachel regularly engaged with key clients and opposing party counsel. She also reviewed and revised settlement offers for attorney approval. 

In order to pursue an interest in estate planning and broaden her legal expertise, Rachel accepted an opportunity with the Law Offices of Julia P. Wald, a firm specializing in estate planning, trust administration, probate and conservatorships. In that role she interacted with clients, attorneys, outside counsel and courts. 
Rachel reviews and drafts estate planning documents and grant deeds. She also leads online research efforts around real property ownership, calendaring court deadlines and managing filing processes. She is entrusted with firm operations, interviewing potential hires, training new employees, day-to-day banking and financial transactions, and notarizing firm documents. 

When away from the office, Rachel volunteers. Her strong sense of empathy and dedication to her community is the driving force behind her volunteer activities and outreach. Rachel’s proven commitment to her firm and her strong relationships within the legal ecosystem have led to her hard-earned reputation as a determined advocate and champion for her clients.
